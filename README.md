# Image_Classification

This Classification is based on images of chest x-rayes. After classification the result will show whether the patient 
contains pneumonia or not.
This model will help a lot in healthcare sector to diagnosis a patient.
I  have used transfer learning method(pre trained model) to increase accuracy.
